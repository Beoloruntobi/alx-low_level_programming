Pointers and arrays
These are 2 concepts in programming that are often misunderstood due to their technicalities.
Pointers point to the value in a variable by housing its address while arrays are a list of items with the same data type.
Example:
int n;
int *p;

n = 90;
p = &n;

IN the above example, p houses the address of the variable n.

int arr[5];

arr[0] = 1;
arr[1] = 5;
arr[2] = 90;
arr[3] = 23;
arr[4] = 100;

The above is an example of an array.
The following programs are examples of pointers and arrays implemented:
0-reset_to_98.c
1-swap.c
2-strlen.c
3-puts.c
4-print_rev.c
5-rev_string.c
6-puts2.c
7-puts_half.c
